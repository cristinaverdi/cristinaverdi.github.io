        <title>What is Cloud Computing?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before cloud computing we had to build our data centers around guessing what the maximum peaks might be. This may present two inconvenients. If our designs didn’t mirror exactly the actual peaks, our users might suffer. On the other hand, if we overplanned and exceeded our maximum peaks, we end up paying for resources that we actually don’t need.
t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cloud Computing, instead of having to design and build our own data centers, we access a data center and all of its resources via the internet allowing us to scale up or down based on our actual needs, without having to plan for the worst case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With AWS we can access servers, databases, storage and higher level applicantion components in seconds. We can treat this as flexible and temporary resources free of the constraints of on premise infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using AWS we can reduce risk, automatically scale our computing to meet our needs, ensure reliable coverage even in the face of a Natural disaster and secure our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing can reduce risks by being Agile, being able to learn and quickly adapt to change. This agility reduces the cost of change. So how do you reduce the risk of a large IT investment, not returning enough benefits? You seek the results of the investment and you pivot as soon as possible if you aren’t seeing those results. And how do you reduce your security risks? Test often, patch quickly and respond to incidents. All this approches to risk management are enabled by the cloud. Cloud services are designed to respong quickly and elasticly to the changing market. This facilitates scalability, agility and innovation and with prebuilt services that can be assembled like building blocks, it is possible to automate software delivery and create security and compliant apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scalabillity&quot;&gt;Scalabillity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cloud computing, scalability means the ability to resize your resources as necessary. By using AWS customers can grow, shrink and adapt their consumption of resources to meet seasonal requirements, lunch new services and products or simply accommodate new strategic directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AWS Cloud delivers a scalable computing platform designed for high availability, independability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud results in increased agility: factors that influence agility: increasing speed, ease of experimentation and cultivating a culture of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, with AWS, you can spin up servers in minutes and shut down servers when you don’t need them anyomore or put them to work for a different purpose. With virtual and automatable resources you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage or configurations. For example, by using AWS CloudFormation, you have access to a consistent template based environment for development, test and production purposes with increasing levels of operational control. Cloud computing allows you to expiriment quickly with low cost and low risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;elasticity&quot;&gt;Elasticity&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like agility, elasticity is also a powerful force in cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elasticity is the power to scale cloud components up or down easily. Because the AWS Cloud is elastic you can quickly deploy new applications, instantly scale up as the workload grows and instantly shut down resources that are no longer required. So wheter you one computer or thousands, whether you need a computer for hours or 24/7, AWS Cloud provides and elastic infrastucture that can meet your needs. Using tools like autoscaling and load balancing, your application can automatically scale up or down based on demand. Backed by AWS infrastucture you can provide service to your users in multiple regions with lower latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reliability&quot;&gt;Reliability&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cloud computing, reliability means being able to aquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve reliability, your architecture and systems must have a well planned foundation that handles changes on demand, detects failures and automatically heals itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;aws-regions&quot;&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliability is a key component of the AWS Cloud, that’s why AWS data centers are located all over the world in what we call AWS regions. Each regions is a geographically separated area that has multiple isolated locations know as availability zones. Availability zones consist of one or more discrete data centers whith each redundant power, networking and connectivity housed in separate facilities. So when you use AWS Cloud you can place resources like instances and data in multiple locations. That leads to reliability because if you’d host all your resources in a single location, and that location would fail, none of your resources would be available. Using availability zones let you operate production applications and databases that are highly available, fault tolerant and scalable better that what is possible with one single data center. The structure of our availability zones is intentional and tightly related to fault tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;fault-tolerance&quot;&gt;Fault tolerance&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fault tolerant means a system can remain operational even if some components of that system fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the built-in redundancy of an application’s components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High availability ensures that your systems are always funtioning and accesible and that downtime is minimized as much as possible without the need for human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
