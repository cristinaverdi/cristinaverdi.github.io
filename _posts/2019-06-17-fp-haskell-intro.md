In this series about Functional programming Foundations, you'll find a summarized version of the contents presented in the [_Functional Programming with Haskell_ course by Erik Meijer](https://www.edx.org/es/course/introduction-to-functional-2) 

## Overview
Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments.

Among other features, functional programing languages offer:

- A compact notation for writing programs
- Powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs
- A simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs

Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Racket and many others, support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.

## Why Haskell?

While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients for programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.

Understanding the _Why_, _What_, and _How thatunderlies pure funcitonal programming will help us to "think like a fundamentalist", so that we can apply the concepts of functional programming to "code like a hacker" in mainstream programming languages.
