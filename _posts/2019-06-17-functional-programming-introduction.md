Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments.

Among other features, functional programing languages offer:

- A compact notation for writing programs
- Powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs
- A simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs

Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Racket and many others, support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.

## Why Haskell?

While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients for programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.

Understanding the _Why_, _What_, and _How that underlies pure funcitonal programming will help us to "think like a fundamentalist", so that we can apply the concepts of functional programming to "code like a hacker" in mainstream programming languages.

## Make some fire even without matches

Let me tell you a little bit of story. One day I was about to prepare some lunch when I realized that I've run out of matches and in consequence, wasn't able to turn on the gas stove. I looked in every corner and drawer in the kitchen but couldn't find any lighter either, at some point I remembered an 'innovative' trick that my mum used to do very often. I took an old newspaper and rolled a sheet, then walked towards the boiler and used the flame in order to burn the end of my improvised match. Yes, this method was a bit rudimentary but yet, I managed to turn on the gas stove :P.

This is exactly the kind of mindset that you have to apply at work in order to code in a functional style even if you are not using a pure functional language. At the end of the day languages are just tools that we manouver according to some fundamentals. 

## Why Functional Programming now? The Software Crisis

It's not a secret that there's is an increasing interest in the industry in order to enable developers to deliver correct software, faster in order to reduce the cost of development and lead time. As developers we all know how challenging this goal can be, so the question is how can we make software in a way that we are confident of its correctness and at the same time, that we can make it fast. Well, as we can see by going through the last features of many modern languages, we can do that by incorporating functional programming concepts into this features, allowing develop to code in a functional style. Many of the end goal of this features is to allow a more concise expression and a higher level of abstraction. As we will see, all these techniques are based on [lambda calculus fundamentals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculusk.

Join me in the next post where we will discover what a Functional Language is and will compare functional vs imperative programming and how to apply the _Functional Style_ to mainstream languages.

I hope you enjoy learning the fundamentals of functional programming during this series.
